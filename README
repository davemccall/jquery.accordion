accordion

A very simple jQuery accordion/drawer widget

Will turn every even item within the container element
into a handle and every odd item into a drawer.
When handles are clicked, drawers either open or close.
If a drawer has a css class "open" it will be open.

Documentation and licence in js header.

sample.htm will show usage.
